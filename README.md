# employeeDirectory

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their non-sensitive information.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create an employee directory using React.This requires breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state and responding to user events.

The intent of such a directory is to provide users with quick access to an array of information for reference. No sensitive information is accessed via this database.

## Business Context

## Installation

This application requires....

## Usage

An application of this type is meant for use within an intranet portal rather than a public domain despite the data manipulated being considered non-sensitive. Employees' full name, contact information and photo may be available via professional network services online at their discretion but is totally independent of the directory held within their company/organization for internal use.
